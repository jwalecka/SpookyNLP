# Spooky Natural Language Processing Project


## The Problem

Natural Language Processing has become an important area of study within the last decade. The applications of the field are numerous, ranging from sentiment analysis to text classification to machine translation. Technological improvements and increase in accessibility to deep learning models has further unlocked the power of NLP.

My project is based on the “Spooky Author Identification” prediction competition outlined on the Kaggle website. The objective is to classify sentences by author, where each sentence is written by one of Edgar Allen Poe, HP Lovecraft, or Mary Shelley. I will develop a number of different models and identify which one performs best in this multinomial classification problem. The first step of developing this text classification model involves converting each sentence into a vector. There are a number of potential approaches here that include simpler vectorizers that implement a bag-of-words method as well as more complicated approaches such as deep learning embedding layers. The second step of the model includes using the vectorized text data to train different machine learning and deep learning models. 

Once I have identified the most effective model when it comes to classifying text, I will build an interactive python notebook that allows the user to input their own sentence and return information that indicates what author’s writing the input text resembles the most.
